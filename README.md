This is a personal website created and mantained by Patryk Chojecki. This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. It was forked from [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which itself is a fork of [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Both of those run under the MIT license. I customized the theme to fit my personal needs.

This website uses basic analytics provided by Cloudflare. I do not keep any information about the visitors besides what Cloudflare gives me.

Resources that helped me in creating this site:
- [Configure Custom Domain and Sub-domain with GitHub Pages in Cloudflare](https://ictsolved.github.io/configure-custom-domain-and-sub-domain-with-github-pages-in-cloudflare/)

This is a test of a small change to the readme file.
