This is a personal website created and mantained by Patryk Chojecki. This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. It was forked from [academicpages/academicpages.github.io](academicpages/academicpages.github.io), which itself is a fork of [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Both of those run under the MIT license. I customized the theme to fit my personal needs.
