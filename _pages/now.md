## About this Page

This is a /now page inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs). This is the place where I describe what I've been up to recently, what I'm currently focused on, and talk about some short-term goals. When I first learned about this concept, it immediately appeared very appealing to me because I rarely use social media.

The concept is quite straightforward, and if you would like to learn more about it, visit [this website](https://nownownow.com/about). If you have your own personal website, you may want to consider making a /now page too.

## Current Thoughts

- I'm going to Poland tomorrow! Really looking forward to seeing my family and friends, and eating lots of quality bread.  
- In terms of fundraising, the biotech sector seems to be slowing down. Many investors I've met recently are hesitant to deploy capital due to the uncertain macro environment. The M&A transactions I've been working on have also experienced some soft delays. Many startups are stuck in limbo.
- I still believe thereâ€™s a lot of untapped value in Japanese life science startups, especially those in niche areas. Many of these companies have existed for years, are run by scientists, and have struggled to attract investor attention. This seems to be an area significantly overlooked by both global and regional VCs. I've been thinking about writing a longer piece on the potential of Japanese pre-clinical biotechs, the success they can aim for when going global, and the challenges they will need to overcome.
