# Hi, Iâ€™m Patryk ðŸ‘‹  

I am 26 years old, and I come from Poland. I've lived in Taipei for almost 5 years at this point. I moved here shortly after I graduated from [the Jagiellonian University in Cracow](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start). I am fluent in three languages. Those include English, Chinese, and Polish.

If you would like to know what I'm currently up to you should visit my [/now page](https://chojecki.net/now/).
  
From 2020 to 2022, I was a recipient of [the Taiwan International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) Scholarship](https://www.icdf.org.tw/wSite/np?ctNode=31561&mp=2). It is an elite program for gifted students from all around the world, which allowed us to spend two incredible years at a university at the [National Chengchi Universit](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taiwan. I am forever grateful to the Taiwanese government for providing me this opportunity.

During my masterâ€™s degree, I worked as a contributing researcher for [Taiwan Architecture & Building Center (TABC)](https://www.tabc.org.tw/en/). There, I gained valuable experience in marketing, business, and B2B relationships. At TABC, I wrote numerous articles on governance, economy, and ESG investing. Together with my team, we were honored with the Excellence Award at the 2021 [DIGI+ X TCA](https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/all-alliance-partners-en/mofa) Global Digital Talent Awards for our innovative service. This service utilized [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist business owners in regulatory compliance.

From mid 2022 to mid 2023,  I worked  as a full-time research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en). Most of my duties involved categorizing and collecting data on projects related to the US government.

Currently, I work as a research associate for a cell & gene therapy (CGT) startup accelerator. We advise new ventures on how to reach the market and optimize their technology.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football, squash, and tennis, reading about emerging technologies and philosophy as well as exploring unknown to me parts of Taiwan. I also love to discover various macOS tools and sometimes even write about them.
