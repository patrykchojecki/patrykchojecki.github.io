# Hi, Iâ€™m Patryk ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a 27-year-old professional with a passion for startups, technology, and financial markets. Originally from Poland, Iâ€™ve spent the past five years living in Taipei, where Iâ€™ve worked at the intersection of business, research, and venture capital.

I graduated from [Jagiellonian University in Cracow](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start) and later earned my masterâ€™s degree at [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taiwan, where I was a recipient of the [Taiwan ICDF Scholarship](https://www.icdf.org.tw/wSite/np?ctNode=31561&mp=2). This program brought together top talent from around the world, giving me the opportunity to deepen my expertise in political economy while building strong international connections.  

My professional journey has taken me across multiple industries. I first contributed to the [Taiwan Architecture & Building Center (TABC)](https://www.tabc.org.tw/en/), focusing on business development, ESG investing, and digital transformation. My team was honored with the Excellence Award at the 2021 [DIGI+ X TCA](https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/all-alliance-partners-en/mofa) Global Digital Talent Awards for our AI-driven compliance solution using [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM).

After that, I worked as a research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en), Taiwanâ€™s most prestigious research institution, where I analyzed U.S. government agencies.

Currently, I work as an associate at a cell & gene therapy (CGT) startup accelerator. My role involves advising biotech startups on fundraising, market strategy, and business development. Iâ€™ve helped multiple companies navigate cross-border investment, particularly between Taiwan, Japan, and Southeast Asia. My expertise spans financial structuring and early-stage venture growth. Professionally, my goal is always to create value for everyone involved, whether itâ€™s startups, investors, or strategic partners. If youâ€™re curious about what we do, check out our [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/celltech-accelerator/) profile.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football and squash. I also love reading about emerging technologies, philosophy, and financial markets. When Iâ€™m not working or training, I enjoy traveling across Asia and discovering new macOS apps and productivity tools.
