# Hi, Iâ€™m Patryk ðŸ‘‹  

I am 25 years old, and I come from Poland. Taipei is the city that I love the most, and I am fortunate enough to call it my current home. I moved here shortly after I graduated from [the Jagiellonian University in Cracow](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start). I am fluent in three languages. Those include English, Chinese, and Polish. In the future I plan to learn Japanese.  
  
As of right now, I work as a full-time research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en). Most of my duties involve categorizing and coding data on projects related to the US government. In the future, the fields I would like to conduct my independent research are international political economy, development economics, and emerging technology policy.  
  
From 2020 to 2022, I was a recipient of [the Taiwan International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) Scholarship](https://www.icdf.org.tw/wSite/np?ctNode=31561&mp=2). It is an elite program for gifted students from all around the world, which allowed us to spend two incredible years at a university in Taiwan. I am forever grateful to the Taiwanese government for providing me this opportunity.  
  
During my masterâ€™s degree, I worked as a contributing researcher and writer for [Taiwan Architecture & Building Center (TABC)](https://www.tabc.org.tw/en/). At that institution, Iâ€™ve gained a lot of experience in marketing, business, and B2B relationships. While at TABC, Iâ€™ve written many articles on governance, economy, and ESG investing. Together with my team, weâ€™ve won the Excellence Award at the 2021 [DIGI+ X TCA](https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/all-alliance-partners-en/mofa) Global Digital Talent Awards for creating a service which used Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid business owners in regulatory compliance. Links to my work can be found in the publications tab at the top of the page.  
  
In my free time, I enjoy playing football, squash, and tennis, reading about emerging technologies and philosophy as well as exploring unknown to me parts of Taiwan. I also love to discover various macOS tools and write about them. When I feel even more inspired I learn programing languages like Python or R (and even Apple Script).
