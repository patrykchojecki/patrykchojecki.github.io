# Hi, Iâ€™m Patryk ðŸ‘‹  

I am 27 years old and have lived in Taipei for almost five years. I moved here shortly after graduating from [the Jagiellonian University in Cracow](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start). I am fluent in three languages: English, Chinese, and Polish.

If youâ€™d like to know what Iâ€™m currently up to, feel free to visit my [/now page](https://chojecki.net/now/) or follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.world/@cherrysandwich">Mastodon</a>.

From 2020 to 2022, I was a recipient of [the Taiwan International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) Scholarship](https://www.icdf.org.tw/wSite/np?ctNode=31561&mp=2). This elite program for talented students from around the world allowed me to spend two incredible years studying at [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en) in Taiwan. I am deeply grateful to the Taiwanese government for providing me with this opportunity.

During my masterâ€™s program, I worked as a contributing researcher for [Taiwan Architecture & Building Center (TABC)](https://www.tabc.org.tw/en/). There, I gained valuable experience in marketing, business, and fostering B2B relationships. At TABC, I wrote numerous articles on governance, economy, and ESG investing. Within my first six months, my team and I received the Excellence Award at the 2021 [DIGI+ X TCA](https://www.talentcirculationalliance.org/all-alliance-partners-en/mofa) Global Digital Talent Awards for our innovative service. This service utilized [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist business owners in regulatory compliance.

From mid-2022 to mid-2023, I worked as a full-time research assistant at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en), where most of my duties involved categorizing and collecting data on projects related to U.S. government agencies and regulations.

Currently, I work as an associate for a cell & gene therapy (CGT) startup accelerator. We advise new ventures on how to reach the market and optimize their technology. If youâ€™d like to learn more about what we do, check out our [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/celltech-accelerator/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing football and squash, reading about emerging technologies and philosophy, and exploring parts of Asia that are new to me. I also love discovering various macOS apps and tools.
