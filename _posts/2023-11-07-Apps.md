Last updated on 27 March 2024 in Taipei, Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼.

I always enjoy reading or watching YouTube videos about how people use their devices, and more specifically, the apps that catch their interest. When I came across this post by [Birchtree](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/), I quickly decided to create my own list.

I also included some brief explanations for why I chose to stick with these apps and services. It's worth mentioning that I'm a dedicated Apple user, and I tend to favor Apple's default apps unless there's a third-party option that offers significant advantages.

- **Mail Service:** [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) - It's been the same for about 15 years; however recently I've been exploring [iCloud Mail](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102540) with my custom domain.
- **Mail Client:** Apple Mail
- **Tasks:** Apple Reminders
- **Calendar:** Apple Calendar on Mac and [Calendars 5](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-by-readdle/id697927927) on iPhone.
- **Notes:** Apple Notes for all personal stuff, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for most work-related notes, TextEdit if I need to draft something quickly when I'm working on my Mac.
- **Text Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- **Messaging:** [Signal](https://signal.org) and sometimes [LINE](https://line.me/en/) because it's impossible to live in Taiwan without it.
- **Maps:** [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) - I wish I could use Apple Maps more often but from my experience in Taiwan they are significantly less useful.
- **RSS Client:** [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)
- **News:** I get most news through my RSS Client, about once a day I also check [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com) and the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com).
- **Launcher:** [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)
- **Cloud Storage:** iCloud and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) for some projects.
- **Presentations:** Keynote if I work alone and (unfortunately) Microsoft PowerPoint if I collaborate with coworkers.
- **Photo Library:** iCloud
- **Photo Editing:** [Photomator](https://www.pixelmator.com/photomator/)
- **Web browser:** Safari and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for some work-related stuff.
- **Weather:** Apple Weather
- **Bookmarks:** [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io)
- **Podcasts:** [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) - Smart Speed saved me over 200 hours already.
- **Music:** Apple Music
- **Clipboard Manager:** [Maccy](https://maccy.app)
- **Password Manager:** [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - I hope to move to Apple Keychain in the future (most likely once passkeys fully take over).
- **Budgeting:** [Expenses](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expenses-spending-tracker/id1492055171) - I want to mention that I manually log every single purchase I make in this app and I've been doing that for about 2 years.
- **Mastodon:** [Elk](https://elk.zone/home) on Mac and [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app) on iPhone.
