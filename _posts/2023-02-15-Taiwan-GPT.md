There are very few things that frustrate me more than governments misusing taxpayers' money. I believe that the most recent effort of the Taiwanese government devoting funds to creating a ChatGPT-like AI chatbot is a prime example of governments following trends they should simply leave to the private sector.

Sophia Yang, reporting for Taiwan News:

> The Taiwan government said this week that it would launch its own AI-powered chatbot as an alternative to counter China's ChatYuan, which pushes Beijing's state-approved narrative.
> Taiwan's version of an artificial intelligence (AI) powered ChatGPT-like chatbot is scheduled for launch by the end of 2023, said Wu Tsung-tsong (吳政忠), head of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), in a media briefing on Monday (Feb. 13). The chatbot will be designed to serve Mandarin speakers using traditional characters.

There is just something about this idea that does not seem very clever to me. Taiwan loves to join international (and especially Western) technology and financial trends. I have yet to see any positive outcomes of those endeavors. I can easily name about a thousand low-hanging fruits that should be copied from the EU or even the US, and yet the DPP government is again focused on efforts that will have a minuscule impact on the average Taiwanese. This is another instance of the Taiwanese government chasing headlines of Western newspapers instead of focusing its efforts on reforms to the domestic economy. From both political and technological perspective there is nothing in this tool that would potentially counter the [Chinese AI chatbots] (https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/chinese-tech-giant-alibaba-working-on-a-chatgpt-rival-shares-jump.html).

> Lee added that Taiwan's chatbot can be more appealing to Mandarin speakers around the world by modeling it using solid AI research from Taiwan's top universities, in addition to the principles of freedom of speech and democracy.

Sounds great on paper, but even if successful the user base of this service would be of minor significance. The potential target has to be Mandarin speakers outside of China. I think it is fair to assume that this bot will be immediately banned/put behind the great Chinese firewall. The number of users that would be capable of using this AI tool but not any English-speaking AI tool is limited. If there are Mandarin speakers that live abroad and use this type of high-tech service, it is fairly likely that they also read/write English. And who said that international AI tools will always be only [limited to English](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6742369-how-do-i-use-the-openai-api-in-different-languages)?

Assuming that within a year or so this service does come out to the public I can't see it being successful. I hope to be proven wrong.

On a positive note at least the Taiwanese government is not openly engaged in a crypto scam, unlike its [counterparts from El Salvador](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-23/el-salvador-bitcoin-experiment).
